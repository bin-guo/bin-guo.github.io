# About Me
I will be an assistant professor at [Trent University](https://www.trentu.ca/) starting in Jan. 2024. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at [McMaster University](https://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from McMaster University in May 2023. I obtained my Master's degree in Applied Computer Science from [Winnipeg University](https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/) in May 2018.

# Research Project
My research interest lies broadly in graphs. Specifically, I study many kinds of graph algorithms in parallel and distributed computing. My Ph.D. studies focus on parallel algorithms of k-core decomposition and maintenance on shared memory multi-core machines. My recent research focuses on parallel or distributed algorithms in terms of graph queries and graph mining.

# Recruit Students
I am seeking highly motivated and dedicated Master's students starting from Winter 2024. Prospective candidates should have a background in __data structure and algorithms__ (especially on graphs), __parallel computing__, and C/C++ programming experience. __If you do not have such a background or your major is not computer science, it does not matter__; we still can talk and make a good research plan. During your master's studies, you will do experiments (mostly C++ programming) and finish a thesis. You will have the opportunity to work closely with me and collaborate with our team members.

Our Computer Science department will provide many funding or scholarship opportunities to cover the tuition fee, like TA; also, I can provide part of the funding to support you. 
If you are interested, please send me your CV and a proposal to my [email](mailto:binguo@trentu.ca). I am happy to be your supervisor.
